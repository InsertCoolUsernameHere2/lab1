		Hello world. This is my first functional website!
	</p>
	<p>
		Hello, happy beginning of the semester! My name is Ashley but you can call me Ash for short. 
		When I'm not working or schooling I like to play rugby, spend time with my dogs, or consume whatever star wars content I haven't gotten to yet.
		I'm a recent transfer so I'm still deciding on extracurriculars to get into on campus, but anything Cybersecurity related is probably what I'll go for first.
