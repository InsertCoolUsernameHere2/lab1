Hello world. This is my first functional website!

	Hello, happy beginning of the semester! My name is Ashley but you can call me Ash for short. 
	When I'm not working or schooling I like to play rugby, spend time with my dogs, or consume whatever star wars content I haven't gotten to yet.
	I'm a recent transfer so I'm still deciding on extracurriculars to get into on campus, but anything Cybersecurity related is probably what I'll go for first.
